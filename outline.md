Owning The Things You Buy - The Right to Repair

# Intro Section

- Some sort of hook?
  - Car breaks down and you have to buy a new one?
- Background on history
- Thesis statement:
  Texas and other states should adopt laws such as HB515 and HB1606

# Confirmatio - Environment

- How much ewaste is generated
  - 150 million mobile phones disposed of (source 42)
    - 1000 miles long if stacked on top of each other
  - Despite making up only 2% of trash dumped, ewaste is 70% of toxic waste (source 54)
  - "When you buy a new laptop, the sticker price doesn't fully account for the rivers poisoned by rare-earth mining, the health hazards of air pollution from gold and nickel mining, and the exploitation of workers." (p36)
  - Repair is not a silver bullet to the vast humanitarian and environmental problems in our global supply chain, but it will definitely help.
- Production is inefficient
  - 4.5 ounce iPhone requires 75 lbs of ore (source 58) and 100 liters of water (source 63)
  - Single laptop generates 1000 lbs of CO2 (source 89)
- Why recycling isn't the solution
  - It just isn't that efficient
  - Recycling is good, but we should repair as much as possible before trying to recycle

# Confirmatio - Small Businesses

- Small businesses are frequently better than the OEM's
  - 92% say that they were able tofix a device that manufacturers couldn't
  - 98% say they can do it for a lower price
  - Use the anecdote from p23 about Apple incompetence
- But that higher skill is being harmed
  - 42% say they frequently turn away customers due to lack of parts, and 53% say they sometimes do.
  - 95% cannot get parts
  - It's unsurprisng that nearly all of these shops support right to repair
- Counterintuitively, it will actually help jobs
  - Source 40 and 41
  - Manufacturing jobs overseas may be lost, but skilled and unautomatable jobs will be gained

# Confirmatio - Consumers

- Our products do not last as long as they should
  - We throw out products that are still working (source 22)
- Repair is overpriced
  - Price of repairing a vehicle has increased 60% from 2000 to 2017 (source 31)
  -
- All of this can save us money
  - US households spend 1500 on electronics per year. Extending these lifespans would save each household 330 anually

# Refutatio

- "What about trade secrets?"
  - These proposed laws have a clause saying that you don't have to distribute
- "What about security?"
  - If publically available repair manuals are what compromises the security of a device, whoever designed that device probably shouldn't be allowed to work as an engineer anymore and those security risks should be the least of your worries.
- "Apple says they lose money on repair"
  - Most likely due to hollywood accounting

# Conclusion

- What you can do:
  - Fix your own stuff
  - Buy from companies like Framework that offer repairable laptops
  - Send letter to representative
