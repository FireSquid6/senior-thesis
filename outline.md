# Intro Section

- Some sort of hook?
  - Car breaks down and you have to buy a new one?

# Third Confirmatio - Repair shops

- Repair shops are generally better than OEM's stuff
  - Cheaper
  - Faster
  - Typically small businesses with passionate owners being swallowed up by big tech
- Repair shops say that they would have to close down and bad things would happen if no right to repair laws

# Refutatio - How it won't actually hurt the companies that much

- "What about security?"
  - Security is the biggest argument against right to repair by large companies. The reality is that if access to repair schematics compromises the security of the product, the product was very poorly designed.
- "What about IP"
  - Law says that companies don't have to disclose trade secrets
- Video game industry and piracy
  - It's not like it is difficult to pirate stuff
  - "The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're reveiving from the pirates" - Gabe Newell
- "What about Apple's shift?"
  - Oddly enough, one of the biggest companies fighting against right to repair, Apple, has done a complete 180 with the recent IPhone 14 and IPhone 15 and their backing of California's right to repair bill. It's even gained some support at the Federal level from President Biden. While it's great that 
  - Joke about "one of the few times where California does something better than us"
