# Confirmatio - Environment

- How much ewaste is generated
  - 150 million mobile phones disposed of (source 42)
    - 1000 miles long if stacked on top of each other
  - Despite making up only 2% of trash dumped, ewaste is 70% of toxic waste (source 54)
  - "When you buy a new laptop, the sticker price doesn't fully account for the rivers poisoned by rare-earth mining, the health hazards of air pollution from gold and nickel mining, and the exploitation of workers." (p36)
  - Repair is not a silver bullet to the vast humanitarian and environmental problems in our global supply chain, but it will definitely help.
- Production is inefficient
  - 4.5 ounce iPhone requires 75 lbs of ore (source 58) and 100 liters of water (source 63)
  - Single laptop generates 1000 lbs of CO2 (source 89)
- Why recycling isn't the solution
  - It just isn't that efficient
  - Recycling is good, but we should repair as much as possible before trying to recycle

  - 92% say that they were able tofix a device that manufacturers couldn't
  - 98% say they can do it for a lower price
  - Use the anecdote from p23 about Apple incompetence
- But that higher skill is being harmed
  - 42% say they frequently turn away customers due to lack of parts, and 53% say they sometimes do.
  - 95% cannot get parts
  - It's unsurprisng that nearly all of these shops support right to repair
- Counterintuitively, it will actually help jobs
  - Source 40 and 41
  - Manufacturing jobs overseas may be lost, but skilled and unautomatable jobs will be gained
