Owning The Things You Buy - The Right to Repair

# Intro Section

- Hook: my stupid oven situation
  - I could also talk about our TV
- Background on history
- Thesis statement:
  Texas and other states should adopt laws such as HB515 and HB1606

# Confirmatio - Environment

- How much ewaste is generated
  - 150 million mobile phones disposed of (source 42)
    - 1000 miles long if stacked on top of each other
  - Despite making up only 2% of trash dumped, ewaste is 70% of toxic waste (source 54)
  - "When you buy a new laptop, the sticker price doesn't fully account for the rivers poisoned by rare-earth mining, the health hazards of air pollution from gold and nickel mining, and the exploitation of workers." (p36)
  - Repair is not a silver bullet to the vast humanitarian and environmental problems in our global supply chain, but it will definitely help.
- Production is inefficient
  - 4.5 ounce iPhone requires 75 lbs of ore (source 58) and 100 liters of water (source 63)
  - Single laptop generates 1000 lbs of CO2 (source 89)
- Why recycling isn't the solution
  - It just isn't that efficient
  - Recycling is good, but we should repair as much as possible before trying to recycle

# Confirmatio - Small Businesses

- Small businesses are frequently better than the OEM's
  - 92% say that they were able tofix a device that manufacturers couldn't
  - 98% say they can do it for a lower price
  - Use the anecdote from p23 about Apple incompetence
- But that higher skill is being harmed
  - 42% say they frequently turn away customers due to lack of parts, and 53% say they sometimes do.
  - 95% cannot get parts
  - It's unsurprisng that nearly all of these shops support right to repair
- Counterintuitively, it will actually help jobs
  - Source 40 and 41
  - Manufacturing jobs overseas may be lost, but skilled and unautomatable jobs will be gained

# Confirmatio - Consumers

- Our products do not last as long as they should
  - We throw out products that are still working (source 22)
- Repair is overpriced
  - Price of repairing a vehicle has increased 60% from 2000 to 2017 (source 31)
  - Costs of replacements parts are inflating. GM reports 30% profit margins on aftermarket parts (source 32)
  - That isn't nearly as bad as companies like John Deer, who make 5 times more from repair than sales (source 34)
  - If a company makes money from fixing their products, they are incentivized to make products that break.
- All of this can save us money
  - US households spend 1500 on electronics per year. Extending these lifespans would save each household 330 anually
  - We saved at least 10 billion repairing instead of replacing in 2017
    - This is with the overpriced $170 screen repairs
    - Independent repair shops or DIY replacements could be much cheaper
  - Won't prices go up?
    - Prices will go up, but that's a good thing.
    - Price lets us in on "the secret" on how long a device will last
- Repair has social benefits
  - "Once you understand how a technology works, why it fails, and how it can be repaired, the leap to developing an improvement is a small one."
  -

# Refutatio

- "What about trade secrets?"
  - These proposed laws have a clause saying that you don't have to distribute
- "What about security?"
  - If publically available repair manuals are what compromises the security of a device, whoever designed that device probably shouldn't be allowed to work as an engineer anymore and those security risks should be the least of your worries.
- "Apple says they lose money on repair"
  - Most likely due to hollywood accounting. If they truly are losing money on repair, that's on them for just being bad at business. If it's too hard, why don't they let the independent repair shops take care of it?

# Conclusion

- What you can do:
  - Fix your own stuff
  - Buy from companies like Framework that offer repairable laptops
  - Send letter to representative
