This could be a gold mine:
https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair

Reasons its good:
More local jobs
Fix digital divide
Hurting small businesses

Call to action:

- Don't buy products you can't fix

Look into breaking Sherman antitrust act?

"would you buy a car if you couldn't replace the tires? So why buy a phone if you can't replace the battery?"

# Small Business and Repair Shops

- https://pirg.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/National-Repair-Shop-Survey_0.pdf
- ^ Actual data this is very good
- 92% of Ind. Shops were able to fix a device that the manufacturer couldn't
- 98% were able to do it for a lower price
- However, 42% of these skilled technicians say they frequently have to turn away customers due to lack of access to parts, and 54% say they occasionally have to.
- 95% strongly support right to repair

# Refutations

- "How much does apple make from overpriced repairs?"
  - It's hard to know
- "What about security?"
  - Ability to modify your hardware doesn't mean the ability to redistribute it. These laws will still protect the trade secrets of the companies.
- "What about John Deere saying people will pirate music in their in car computer?"
  - That would be the most convoluted way to pirate media ever. If you manage to do that, you should get an award.
