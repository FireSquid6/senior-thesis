- ^ Actual data this is very good
- 92% of Ind. Shops were able to fix a device that the manufacturer couldn't
- 98% were able to do it for a lower price
- However, 42% of these skilled technicians say they frequently have to turn away customers due to lack of access to parts, and 54% say they occasionally have to.
  - OEMs are unfairly creating a barrier to higher skilled competition
- 95% strongly support right to repair
- Anecdote about Apple being incompetent on p23 (source 37)

- More repairability = more local jobs
  - Source 40 and 41
  - Manufacturing jobs may be lost, but local jobs are gained
  - Repair jobs are:
    - More skilled
    - difficult to automate
    - benefits local businesses

# How it helps consumers

- Products don't last as long as they should p19, source 13
- Consumers typically replace their smartphone every two years p19, source 20, with higher income families more willing to replace than repair (source 27)
- We throw out products that are still working p20, source 22 Resale market is 25 billion annually, source 23
- KEY DATA: US household spends 1500 per year on electronics. Extending these lifespans would save each household 330 annually, and $40 billion across the whole consumer economy. (source 29)
- MORE KEY DATA: See p 22 on savings from repair (source 30)
- However, repair is getting more expensive
  - from 2000 to 2017 the price of repairing a vehicle increased by 60% (source 31)
  - This is attributed to rising cost of replacement parts (GM 30% margins on aftermarket parts) (source 32)
- For John Deere, repair is 5 times more expensive than equipment sales (source 34)
  - If it's profitable for the company to fix stuff, they are encouraged to make products that break
- Social benefits: "Once you understand how a technology works, why it fails, and how it can be repaired, the leap to developing an improvement is a small one." (p45)

# Environmental

- E-waste
  - We dispose of 150 million mobile phones per year (source 42)
    - If stacked on top of each other, assuming each phone has a width of 1 cm, a stack around 1000 miles long would be formed.
  - Discarded consumer electronics accounts for 54 million tons of ewaste per year (source 43)
  - Ewaste is harmful because:
    - Despite making up only 2% of trash dumped in landfills, ewaste makes up 70% of toxic waste (source 48)
    - abormal development, increases in premature and still births, and reduced childhood growth rates (source 50)
    - Waste ends up in poor countries (source 51)
  - Production issues
    - 4.5 ounce iPhone requires 75 lbs of ore (source 58)
    - Single smartphone costs 100 liters of water to produce (source 63)
    - Australian mining firm left a ton of waste and got a bunch of kids sick (source 64)
  - All of the terrible things that happen in the DRC see p32 and 33
  - Pollution
    - Single laptops generates 1000 lbs of CO2 (source 89)
  - Delivery pollutes see p35
  - Use the quote "When you buy a new laptop, the sticker price, doesn't fully account for the rivers poisoned by rare-earth mining, the health hazards of air pollution from gold and nickel mining, and the exploitation of workers." p36
- Recycling isn't amazing
  - p38 it's very inefficient
  - While we should still try to recycle stuff, we should recycle it once it is actually at the end of its lifespan

# Refutations

- "How much does apple make from overpriced repairs?"
  - It's hard to know
- "What about security?"
  - Ability to modify your hardware doesn't mean the ability to redistribute it. These laws will still protect the trade secrets of the companies.
- "What about John Deere saying people will pirate music in their in car computer?"
  - That would be the most convoluted way to pirate media ever. If you manage to do that, you should get an award.
- "Apple says they lose money on repair"
  - Nobody really knows why
  - best theory has to do with "Hollywood accounting" (source 38)
- "Will increased repairability increase costs?"
  - See p25

- Pandemic was very bad for rural families without access to electronics
