# Owning the Things You Buy

## Exordium

    Last summer my family’s oven broke. The first problem this caused was the oven not turning off. I would have to go outside and flip the breaker to turn the oven off. Later, the problem got worse and our oven turned into the “quantum oven”— cooking normally with an observer, but burning everything when nobody was looking. We would put the oven on 250 degrees, and it would instead heat to 450. We called GE, the manufacturer of the oven, and asked if they could fix it. They said that it was a board issue and couldn’t be replaced. They advised us to just buy an entirely new oven. We decided not to buy a new oven. Instead we called in (note to grader- this happened on Friday at 5 PM. Wasn’t able to get his name or anything so I’ll fix this in the next draft) a local repairman who told the truth. Our oven didn’t even have this magical temperature control board—it was just a simple and cheap relay. The repairman was able to grab the part from his minivan and fix it in 15 minutes or so. GE directly lied to us about the repairability of their product to get us to buy another one
    While blatant lies and deception for profits are mostly a GE thing, my family’s repair experience is not an uncommon one, regardless of the brand. This is what has caused the right to repair movement to start.

## Narratio

    In our increasingly technologically dependent world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to fix our devices. This isn’t an accident—companies deliberately incorporate “planned obsolescence” into their products to force you to buy new ones. The greatest example of this comes from the 1920s light bulb cartel. This sounds like a joke—but it isn’t. This “Phoebus Cartel” worked to standardize the lifespan of lightbulbs from the then 2500 hours to 1000 hours. This was, of course, because if light bulbs didn’t last as long, people would need to buy more. The Phoebus Cartel disbanded once World War Two started, and now our modern LED’s can last in the tens of thousands of hours. However, this idea of intentionally making products break sooner continues to plague our modern devices, largely in the form of anti-repair design. This means irreplaceable batteries, using glue instead of screws, and putting patronizing advice such as, “Repairs performed by untrained individuals or using non-genuine Apple parts may affect the safety and functionality of the device,” in product manuals. Additionally, companies will deliberately create overpriced repair solutions and attack third party repair shops. I’m not the only one who's had an oven-like experience, and many have got together to demand that it is their right to repair the products they own.

    The largest of these groups is the company iFixit. They provide guides, tools, and parts to help you and repair shops fix their devices. However, there are large barriers to their business. A study consisting of 8403 consumers with repair experiences from 2013 showed that the willingness to repair a broken product had a large effect on the opinion of the product. However, it also found that the main barriers to repair are lack of access to parts, tools, and manuals. Right to repair is widely supported. In Washington’s 2021 Right to Repair Bill, there were no citizens fighting against it. The only opposition came from lobbyists.

    Other states, such as California and Massachusetts, have pro repair laws, but most of them are too new to have any measurable impact. However, France implemented a Repairability Index on January 1 2021. This is a 1-10 scale indicating how easy it is to repair products, similar to the iFixIt repairability scale we have. They state that the goal is to combat waste and to “raise consumer’s awareness of the possibility of extending the lifespan and use of their devices, in particular by directing their purchase behavior towards products that are more easily repairable and by encouraging them to resort more to repairs in the event of a breakdown.” A report by Halt Obsolescence showed that 55% of people are familiar with the index, and three fourths of consumers in contact with the index used it to make a purchasing decision. This shows that consumers want to repair their products when given the information, but that repair is still difficult in the US.

## Propositio

    Currently two laws are in the Texas House to address this issue. HB515 would give farmers access to the software, tools, and repair manuals they need to fix their tractors, harvesters, and other “heavy equipment.” HB1606 does the same thing as HB515, but for “digital electronic equipment” such as your phone and laptop. There are also provisions in the law to protect companies from revealing trade secrets. Texas and other states should pass laws like HB515 and HB1606 for several reasons. First, they will benefit local small businesses and create more jobs. Second, they will benefit the environment and help the humanitarian issues caused by the production of these products. And finally, they will benefit the consumers of the products by saving them money and creating longer lasting products.

## Confirmatios

### Confirmatio 1

_Note to grader:
I know this point kinda sucks. It needs more evidence that I’m gonna get by talking to some local repair shops_

    While the seller of your device may be the first place you think to go, they aren’t always the best. From a pirg survey of independent repair shops, nearly  every single one of the participants said that they were able to fix a device that the manufacturer couldn’t (92%) and that they were able to fix that product for a lower price (98%). This higher skill from manufacturers isn’t just self reported. Take Greg Benz for example—he had a common issue where his display kept going dark. After the apple geniuses (this isn’t sarcasm. That’s actually what they’re called) troubleshot for a while, they gave up and sent the laptop to Texas for repair and gave Benz a temporary computer. However, this new laptop began to have the same issue a few months later. Again, Benz took this new laptop to the genius bar again, where they eventually realized that the display brightness was just on zero. After 2 replaced logic boards, $10,000, troubleshooting from several apple geniuses, diagnostic tests at Apple’s repair facility, and 2 weeks of lost time; the issue turned out to be the equivalent of the screen just not being turned on. These smaller repair shops don’t suffer from the same corporate bloat that the OEM does.

    These higher skilled and cheaper alternatives are being unfairly attacked by the larger OEM’s. From that same survey, about half of the participants said they frequently have to turn away customers due to lack of available parts, while the other half said they occasionally have to. Only a measly 9 shops out of the 253 surveyed said that they have never needed to turn away customers due to lack of parts. Continuing with that line of reasoning, nearly every one of the shops surveyed said that they strongly support the right to repair laws, and that their business might be in danger without them.

    Due to the restrictions on repair, these local repair shops have been on the decline. For example, in 1966, there were 310,000 people employed in home appliance and television repair. Today, there are only 70,000. All of this occurred while the US population increased from about 190 million to 340 million. With some quick algebra, this is approximately 500,000 jobs we’re missing out on due to the lack of repairability. Additionally, these aren’t low skilled manufacturing jobs, but highly skilled and hard to automate trades. Repair jobs are also more local than the manufacturing jobs they would replace. 500,000 might even be a low estimate, given how much more dependent we are on these devices than from the 60s. Wouldn’t it be ridiculous if you went to the mechanic to get your transmission repaired, and they couldn’t fix it because the manufacturer of the car didn’t let them buy the parts?

### Confirmatio #2

    The environment is another crucial aspect of repair. EWaste is a massive environmental problem. It may not appear that bad on paper, since it only makes up 2% of trash dumped. However, this miniscule 2% accounts for 70% of all toxic waste (source 42). We also dispose of around 150 million mobile phones every year. To put this number into perspective, these phones stacked on top of each other (assuming each phone has a width of 1 cm) would make a stack 1000 miles long, about the distance from Houston to Phoenix.

    This waste is incredibly harmful to the communities nearby. For example, a study by the New Delhi Department of Civil engineering found that heavy metal concentration near e-waste sites is 30 times higher than normal in topsoil, and 120 times higher than normal for subsoil. The full effects of this contamination are still being researched, but the consensus is that it is definitely harmful. Studies have shown that it can be linked to abnormal reproductive development, premature births and stillbirths, as well as child developmental issues. Additionally, the e-waste is typically dumped in still developing and poorer countries.

    Corporations point at recycling as the solution to this issue, but it’s still far from efficient. In Apple’s 2019 recycling report, they claim that with the use of their cutting edge Daisy recycling robot, they were able to recycle 48,000 metric tons of e waste. While this may seem like an impressive number, it only accounts for 0.1% of e waste. Additionally, not much is actually being put into the recycling process. In their 2019 Environmental Responsibility Report, Apple says that they were able to recycle one million iPhones. Again, this seems impressive, but only represents half of a percent of the phones they sold this year. The steps Apple is taking to make recycling more efficient are admirable, but recycling doesn’t need to be an alternative to repair. Recycling should happen when a product is truly at the end of its life or becomes hopelessly outdated, not just after one year of use.

    We aren’t just throwing away all of our tech, but producing it inefficiently and harmfully as well. A single 4.5 ounce iPhone requires 75 lbs of ore and 100 liters of water. This is using 20 days worth of water for the average person and the weight of 75 1 lb weights to make one device the weight of a pack of playing cards. It’s also important to note that the production of a single laptop produces 1000 lbs of CO2. As Aaron Perzanowski said in his book The Right to Repair, “When you buy a new laptop, the sticker price doesn’t fully account for the rivers poisoned by rare-earth mining, the health hazards of air pollution from gold and nickel mining, and the exploitation of workers.”.
    The ethics and fairness surrounding production brings up issues as well. The city of Baotou in Chinese inner Mongolia is a depressing example of this. It has recently exploded as demand for rare earth metals has gone up. These are elements such as Yttrium, Cerium, Dysprosium, and Neodymium which are crucial to the inner workings of our tech. The area around Baotou is very rich and is estimated to contain 70% of the world’s reserves, but at a great humanitarian cost. The production of these metals destroys the local environment—leaving an alien toxic lake filled with the byproduct of all of the metal extraction. This lake seeps into the local groundwater, poisoning the whole city. By keeping our products for longer we can help end the terrible abuse that happens in these developing cities

    Cobalt is another example of a natural resource that’s being overproduced. The Democratic Republic of the Congo contains around 60% of the world’s supply of this resource, which is used in the lithium-ion batteries in our laptops, phones, and even cars. It is also used in the production of gas turbines, jet engines, and magnetic steel. However, the price we pay for these products is not just monetary. Take Elodie for example. She’s a 15 year old teen mom who has to carry her two month old son every day through the cobalt mines. She spends all day bent over inhaling the toxic fumes, trying to dig up enough cobalt to fill her sack. In one day, she only makes about 65 cents. Stories like hers are not uncommon. Again, these are complex problems that require complex solutions, but every time we choose to replace instead of repair we are forcing more orphan children into toxic and grueling work.

    Of course, none of this would matter if repair can’t actually help. However, a study from Oakdene Hollins on how microsoft devices could reduce emissions showed that repairing the product instead of replacing it can create up to a 92% reduction in potential waste generation and emissions. This of course would not be a silver bullet to instantly solve all of the environmental and humanitarian problems, but a 92% reduction in e waste is not insignificant and would create cascading results throughout. By seeking to repair rather than replace, and by passing laws that make that easier and incentivize companies to do so, we can take better care of our world.

### Confirmatio #3

    Benefits to small businesses and the environment are great, but the most benefit will come to us—the consumers. The most obvious benefit is the economic one. The average US household spends almost $2000 on electronics per year. According to a report by PIRG, if we extend the lifespan of these products by using repair, that same family would save 23% of that, which turns out to be a little under $400 per year for the average family. Across the 129 million households in the US, this adds up to around $50 billion dollars—enough to buy 100 million pounds of bananas—that could be put to use stimulating the economy. This still doesn’t account for the time saved. When your laptop breaks, rather than disposing of it and waiting a few unproductive days for a new one, you can repair your current one in the same day to save both time and money.

    Even with the overpriced repair we deal with today, consumers are still able to save money. Take for example screen repairs. In 2017, Americans broke 50 million phone screens, which is about 2 broken screens every second. If all of these were repaired by the OEMs for an average of $170, it would cost Americans about $8.5 billion. If each of these purchases resulted in buying new phones, however, it would cost around $20 billion. It could be better, however. While Apple charges between  $150-$170 for repairs of phone screens around that time, an independent repair shop such as Rossman Repair group, a repair shop near the University of Texas, charges only between $80 and $120. If instead consumers went to them, it would cost a total of $4.5 billion, saving consumers $4 billion on phone repair. This is without considering what would be gained from this law, meaning that the savings could be even greater.

    Another large benefit will come to the longevity of our products and repair becoming cheaper. We currently throw out products that are still working just fine and deal with overpriced repair. From 2000 to 2017, the price of repairing a vehicle has increased 60%. The cost of replacement parts are inflating, and GM is reporting a 30% profit margin on aftermarket parts. All of this is combining to make fixing our products almost as expensive as buying a new one, as anyone who has visited an apple store can tell you.

    None of these issues of auto parts are as bad as John Deer. John Deer makes 5 times more from repairs as they do from sales. They also use artificial software locks to prevent repair, causing farmers to use hacked Ukrainian software to even use their tractors. If a company makes more from broken products than they are from working ones, they are directly incentivized to make products that break more and are lower quality. Right to repair laws give the companies that make the best products the most success.

    A common counterpoint to the idea of repairable products is the idea that if the company doesn’t make as much from repair, the up front price will go up. This will be true on the frontend: for people buying new products straight off of the shelf, you can expect to see a significant price increase. However, this won’t be as bad as you would think. First, if a product is expensive, you know that it will last. Second, for those who can’t afford brand new products, a revitalized secondhand market will be the goto place. If our products can be repaired and upgraded easier, they can go on to live second, third, and maybe even fourth lives. It’s key to remember that buying cheap frequently means buying twice.

    However some may wonder how this larger upfront cost will affect those with less disposable income. Even if the product is cheaper over a long term, how will those already struggling deal with the large upfront cost? The answer lies in the secondhand market. This is shown most prevalently in cars, where twice as many used cars are sold each year than new cars. People who can afford it and want to can still buy a new iPhone every year, just the old one will continue to live a long second life on the secondhand market. WIth greater repairability our electronic equipment can go from disposable and consumable to having the longevity we see in cars.

    While the economic benefits to consumers are the main benefit, it’s important not to forget the cultural ones. As Aaron Perzanowski says, “Once you understand how a technology works, why it fails, and how it can be repaired, the leap to developing an improvement is a small one.” A culture of doers rather than buyers will lead to greater innovation. Today’s fixers are tomorrow's innovators.

## Refutatio

    The most commonly brought up counter argument by lobbyists is the idea of security. They say that people will be able to use the documentation and repair tools to learn how the security system works and bypass it. The problem with this argument is that it is fallacious at it’s core. Just because I know how a lock works doesn’t mean that should allow me to crack it. If the ability to see the internals of a system compromises its security, whoever designed that system should probably be fired.

    OEMs have worked hard and invested lots into creating these products, so another common argument is that their “unfair” advantage in the repair section is actually their just booty for creating a useful product. The reality is that this law doesn’t take away their advantage, it just forces them to do a good job. When your iPhone breaks, the first place you’ll think to go to is the Apple store. That will still be the case after this law, there will just be other alternatives. However, you won’t ever look at those alternatives if Apple provides a good service at a reasonable price. They still have the advantage, but just have to compete fairly.

_Note to grader:
This is an idea I had for a refutatio the day it’s due. I know that this would need more sources, but I am wondering if I should replace the security paragraph with this one, or keep them both._

    Another common counterargument is the idea that since technology is developing very rapidly, even with Moore’s Law slowing down, devices such as our phones and laptops need to be replaced every few years anyways to stay up to date with the latest hardware, so repair is irrelevant. However, if something can be repaired, it can also be upgraded. This is something that PC enthusiasts have been doing for years. As their computer gets outdated, they don’t throw the whole thing away, rather they just upgrade the specific parts that need it. It’s not uncommon to see “computers of theseus” that have had every part gradually upgraded over a decade or so.

## Conclusion

    In recent months great strides have been made for the right to repair. Companies such as Framework offer repairable laptops to great success, Apple has started offering repair manuals and a new self service repair program, and California recently became the third state to enact a broad right to repair. However, the fight isn’t over. Framework faces great sustainability issues, Apple could very well do another 180 if it becomes profitable, and California’s right to repair act still has exemptions for agricultural products and game consoles. Texas’s HB515 and HB1616 act as another way for consumers to truly own the things they buy.
    Sadly, legislation can only do so much. The law can force companies to offer repair solutions, but it is the burden of the consumer to seek to repair rather than replace. There are several things we can choose to do. First, when buying a new product, you can look at iFixIt’s repair scores to get an idea of how easy the product will be to repair or upgrade. Second, when your product breaks, you can support local businesses by going to a repair shop, rather than the OEM. After all, if you can’t fix it, do you even own it?
